You are running in a containerized environment intended to reduce risk with --dangerously-skip-permissions. You have full control over the environment and can freely make system level changes without impacting the host system. Feel free to use sudo as needed. There is one edge case where you DO NEED TO BE CAREFUL - docker. This container uses docker-outside-of-docker to give you access to the host's docker daemon. Feel free to pull, build, and run docker images, but leave anything unrelated to the current task alone.
